    <p> This is my first Odin project and im really exited of doing it, it means starting my journey as a coder and not leaving behind, but complementing my life as an architect. </p>
    <p> I want to thank TOP for getting me pumped and starting to learn new things, if im able to repay in the future I will be really glad to make this project a better one </p>
    <p> And to all the people, that like me is doing a career change of are at least undecided, JUST DO IT! </p>
